# LevelDesign_3 - ITERATIONS

 Concept 3 for CART315: Ninjutsu Game Mechanic

At its most basic level I am trying to experiment with a mechanic where a player must deliver a sequence of keys before being able to use a power. Taking inspiration from the Naruto world, ninjas must deliver a series of hand signs before being able to use their power. In this game prototype, you must use the "focus mode" + a sequence of digits to activate you fireball jutsu.

Although a free fireball is available right away, to recharge you must deliver the sequence shown at the top left corner. Hold Q and press the keys 1, 2 and 3 respecitvely to charge another fireball.

# Design Journal

For this game prototype I decided to build a gameplay mechanic based on the powers of a franchise anime called Naruto. I wanted to explore the possibility of incorporating "hand weaving" mechanics to summon a special power, sort of like how a wizard would read spells from a book.

Example of hand signs or hand weaving mechanics

There was no level design, the environment was simple because I wanted the focus to be on the "jutsu" mechanic. From today's playtest I've learned that the game mechanics needed to be explained better, a simple tutorial scene ought to suffice to explain the mechanics. I've also learned that using the same hand for entering the key series and shooting the jutsu is cumbersome so I will figure out a way to have the player enter an input combination using a more comfortable manner, such as holding the right mouse button and using your left hand to enter the keys such as Jason suggested.

I will most likely be continuing this prototype as my iterative project, so the things I'd like to get done before next week are the following:

Build a basic environment or level for the player to navigate in, set a series of objectives for the player to stay engaged, animate my character model with more game mechanics such as jumping, dashing, and some basic light attacks.

# Design Journal for Iteration

I've incorporated some basic running animations plus added some more color in the level to make it look nicer. Some changes to the lighting and camera FoV made the game seem wider and more interesting visually. Next I'll be working on the fireball jutsu effect and add a fighting mechanic as well as a simple UI menu to bring up for jutsu or controls.

I've progressed quite a bit on the game. I've improved the effects on the fireball jutsu, I've added some UI to help players better understand how the game mechanics work. As it stands there's no actual "Objective" to the current prototype, however I am looking to add a game objective on the second iteration of the game.

Design Concept Questions:

1. Does the third person camera distance and sensitivity feel correct?
2. Does movement feel correct?
3. Are you able to use and re-use the fireball jutsu?
4. Does the key sequence resemble what you may have seen in Naruto?
5. Does this game mechanic work well with a mouse and keyboard?
6. Are in game instructions clear?
7. Is the current aesthetic of the game suitable?
8. Any visible bugs or anomalies found in the game?
