 Concept 3 for CART315: Ninjutsu Game Mechanic

At its most basic level I am trying to experiment with a mechanic where a player must deliver a sequence of keys before being able to use a power. Taking inspiration from the Naruto world, ninjas must deliver a series of hand signs before being able to use their power. In this game prototype, you must use the "focus mode" + a sequence of digits to activate you fireball jutsu.

Although a free fireball is available right away, to recharge you must deliver the sequence shown at the top left corner. Hold Q and press the keys 1, 2 and 3 respecitvely to charge another fireball.

Design Concept Questions:

1. Does the third person camera distance and sensitivity feel correct?
2. Does movement feel correct?
3. Are you able to use and re-use the fireball jutsu?
4. Does the key sequence resemble what you may have seen in Naruto?
5. Does this game mechanic work well with a mouse and keyboard?
